## Features

### Booking Management

- Add, edit, and delete farmer bookings
- Fields: Farmer Name, Telephone, Tubes Booked, Booking Date, Farm Location
- Amount due and delivery date (booking date + 30 days) are calculated automatically

### WhatsApp Integration

- One-click **WhatsApp** button opens WhatsApp with a pre-filled message
- **Copy Message** button copies the message as plain text to the clipboard
- Message includes: booking confirmation, delivery date, total amount, loading manpower cost, and a note that transport cost will be communicated separately

### Loading Cost Calculation

The loading manpower cost is auto-calculated for every message:

```
Loading Cost = ceil(tubes ÷ 60) × RWF 350
```

Example: 500 tubes = 9 sacks × RWF 350 = **RWF 3,150**

### Report Tab

**On-screen analytics:**

- KPI cards — total bookings, tubes, revenue, upcoming deliveries
- Monthly breakdown (bookings, tubes, revenue, average per booking)
- Bookings by location with percentage share
- Top 5 farmers by volume
- Upcoming deliveries table

**Downloadable PDF report** (pure JavaScript — no Python required):

- Page 1: header banner, KPI cards, monthly summary, location breakdown
- Page 2: full booking register with totals row, upcoming deliveries
- Days remaining colour-coded — 🔴 7 days or fewer, 🟡 14 days or fewer, 🟢 more than 14 days
- Footer on every page with page number and generation timestamp

### Excel Export

Download all bookings as a formatted `.xlsx` file from any screen.

### Offline Fallback

If MongoDB Atlas is unreachable, data is automatically read from and saved to **localStorage**. A live badge in the header shows the current data source: 🟢 MongoDB or 🟡 Offline (localStorage).

### Responsive Design

- **Mobile** (under 768px): sticky bottom navigation, card layout, bottom-sheet modals for WhatsApp and delete
- **Desktop** (768px and above): top navigation bar, row layout, centered booking form, centered modals
- Layout switches instantly when the screen width changes

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v18 or higher
- A free [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com) account

### 1. Enter the project folder

```bash
cd miru-bookings
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up MongoDB Atlas

See the [MongoDB Atlas Setup](#mongodb-atlas-setup) section below.

### 4. Create your environment file

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Open `.env.local` and paste your MongoDB connection string.

### 5. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

---

## MongoDB Atlas Setup

1. Go to [cloud.mongodb.com](https://cloud.mongodb.com) and create a free account
2. Create a new **Project**, then create a **Cluster** — choose the free **M0** tier
3. Go to **Database Access** → **Add New Database User**
   - Choose **Password** authentication
   - Use letters and numbers only in your password — avoid `@`, `!`, `#` as these break the connection URL
   - Grant the user **Read and Write to Any Database**
4. Go to **Network Access** → **Add IP Address**
   - Local development: click **Add Current IP Address**
   - Vercel deployment: click **Allow Access from Anywhere** (`0.0.0.0/0`)
5. Back on your cluster, click **Connect** → **Drivers** → select **Node.js**
6. Copy the connection string — it looks like:
   ```
   mongodb+srv://username:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/
   ```
7. Replace `<password>` with your actual password, then paste the full string into `.env.local`

---

## Environment Variables

Your `.env.local` file should contain:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://youruser:yourpassword@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/miru-bookings?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

**Important notes:**

- Never commit `.env.local` to Git — it is already excluded in `.gitignore`
- The database name `miru-bookings` at the end of the URI is created automatically on the first write
- If your password contains special characters, encode them:
  - `@` → `%40`
  - `!` → `%21`
  - `#` → `%23`

---

## Running Locally

```bash
# Development server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run the production build locally
npm start
```

---

## Deploying to Vercel

Vercel is the recommended platform for this project. **GitHub Pages cannot be used** — it does not support Next.js server-side API routes.

1. Push your project to a GitHub repository (confirm `.env.local` is not committed)
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in with GitHub
3. Click **Add New Project** and import your repository
4. In **Environment Variables**, add:
   - **Name:** `MONGODB_URI`
   - **Value:** your full MongoDB Atlas connection string
5. Click **Deploy**

Vercel automatically redeploys every time you push to your main branch.

## API Reference

All endpoints are under `/api/`. Booking endpoints return JSON; the report endpoint returns a PDF file.

| Method   | Endpoint            | Description            |
| -------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `GET`    | `/api/bookings`     | Fetch all bookings     |
| `POST`   | `/api/bookings`     | Create a new booking   |
| `PUT`    | `/api/bookings/:id` | Update a booking by ID |
| `DELETE` | `/api/bookings/:id` | Delete a booking by ID |
| `GET`    | `/api/report`       | Download PDF report    |

### Booking object

```json
{
  "id": "664abc123def456",
  "name": "Uwimana Claudette",
  "phone": "250788123456",
  "tubes": 500,
  "bookingDate": "2026-02-26",
  "location": "Musanze",
  "createdAt": "2026-02-26T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

All five fields (`name`, `phone`, `tubes`, `bookingDate`, `location`) are required when creating or updating a booking.

---

## Customisation

All key business values are defined in `lib/utils.js`:

| What to change           | Where                     | Current value                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Price per tube           | `PRICE_PER_TUBE` constant | RWF 600                        |
| Delivery window          | `getDeliveryDate()`       | 30 days from booking date      |
| Loading cost rate        | `buildWhatsAppMessage()`  | RWF 350 per sack of 60 tubes   |
| WhatsApp message wording | `buildWhatsAppMessage()`  | —                              |
| Excel file name          | `exportToExcel()`         | `Miru_Mushrooms_Bookings.xlsx` |

To rename the database, change `miru-bookings` in your `MONGODB_URI` to any name you prefer — MongoDB will create it automatically.

## Troubleshooting

**`Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/BookingApp'`**
The `jsconfig.json` file is missing from the project root. Create it:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": { "@/*": ["./*"] }
  }
}
```

**`querySrv EBADNAME` error**
Your MongoDB password contains a special character that breaks the URL. Encode `@` as `%40` and `!` as `%21` in the password portion of your connection string.

**`Python was not found` error when downloading the PDF**
You have an old version of `app/api/report/route.js` that used Python. The current version uses jsPDF (pure JavaScript) and needs no Python. Replace the file and run `npm install` again.

**Blank screen after deploying to GitHub Pages**
GitHub Pages does not support server-side code. Use Vercel instead — it is free and requires no extra configuration.

**🟡 Offline (localStorage) badge in header**
MongoDB Atlas is not reachable. Check:

1. `MONGODB_URI` is correctly set in `.env.local` (or in Vercel environment variables)
2. Your IP address or `0.0.0.0/0` is added under MongoDB Atlas → Network Access
3. The username and password in the URI are correct

**Hydration error on first load**
Ensure `components/BookingApp.js` has `"use client"` on the very first line, and that the inline CSS string uses single quotes inside `input[type='date']` rather than double quotes.
